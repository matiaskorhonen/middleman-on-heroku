# Middleman on Heroku

aka *Clever like a fox*


## What is this?

A simple [Middleman]() static site that's been set-up so that it runs “nicely” on Heroku. This means it doesn't use Webrick as the web server (instead, there's Puma) and pretty URLs are enabled (no ugly `.html` at the end).


## Why?

I write a tutorial about how I set up Middleman to run on Heroku. This repo is a
side effect of that.


## No really, how does this help me?

Read the tutorial here: <http://randomerrata.com/post/56163474367/middleman-on-heroku>

That will probably be enough. If you want to dig into the steps, then after each step I committed the changes and tagged the commit with which step it was.

The code changes after each step in that tutorial are tagged in this repo.
